## Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation *is* to send a pull request. Use your best judgment!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

* Open a new issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/amsul/react-translated/issues) tracker.
* Fork the repo.
* Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch.
* Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
* Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

Thank you for contributing!
